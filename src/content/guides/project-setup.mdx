Once you have Mly.fyi up and running, the next step is to sign up and create a project.

You will then need to go to the project settings page to add the AWS SES credentials. For how to get the AWS SES credentials, you can follow the [configuration guide](/docs/configuration).

<Image src={projectSettings} class="rounded-xl" alt="Project settings" />

Next, you can add identities to the project. An identity is a domain from which you will send emails. You can add multiple identities to a project, and you can send emails from any of the identities.

> **What is an identity?**
> An identity is a domain from which you will send emails. You can add multiple identities to a project, and you can send emails from any of the identities.

To add an identity, you can use the `Add Identity` button from the `Identities` page. Then you can fill the form with the following fields:

- **Domain** - The domain name of the identity. Remember it has to be a APEX domain (e.g. `example.com`).
- **Mail from Domain** - The domain name from which the emails will be sent. It has to be a subdomain of the domain (e.g. `mail.example.com`). You can learn more about it from the [Amazon SES documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/mail-from.html).

Once you fill the form, you can click the `Add Identity` button to add the identity. The identity will be added to the identities list, and know you will get a list of DNS records that you have to add to the domain DNS settings.

After adding the DNS records, you can verify the identity. Once the identity is verified, you can start sending emails from that identity.
