Maily comes with a docker-compose file to help you easily host it yourself. You can deploy it to a VPS, cloud provider, or even your local machine. The app is designed to be deployed anywhere with minimal configuration.

Here are some of the guides to help you deploy the app:

- [Railway](/docs/deploy-railway)
- DigitalOcean (Coming Soon)
- AWS (Coming Soon)
- Google Cloud (Coming Soon)

Note: even though we don't have a guide for your preferred cloud provider, you can still deploy the app anywhere that supports Docker / Docker Compose.

## Running on Local

If you want to run the app to your local machine, you can follow the steps below:

```bash
cp .env .env.production
docker-compose up --build -d
```

> You have to update following environment variables in the `.env.production` file:

```bash
PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:4321
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=/data/db.sqlite3
```
