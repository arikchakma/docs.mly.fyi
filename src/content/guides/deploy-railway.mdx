Deploying on [Railway](https://dub.sh/mly-railway) is easy and straightforward. Railway is a platform that allows you to deploy your apps with ease. It supports various databases, and you can deploy your app with a few clicks.

Follow the steps below to deploy on Railway:

1. Create an account on [Railway](https://dub.sh/mly-railway).
2. Create a new project.
3. Connect your GitHub repository, and select the repository you want to deploy. It will automatically pick the `Dockerfile` and deploy the app.
4. Add the environment variables in the Railway dashboard. You can find the environment variables in the `.env.example` file.
5. You need to add an extra environment variable `PORT=4321` in the Railway dashboard, as Railway uses a different port.

> You can also add a Redis Database from the Railway dashboard, and update the `REDIS_URL` environment variable. (Optional)

That's it! Your app will be deployed on Railway. You can access the app using the URL provided by Railway or your custom domain.
