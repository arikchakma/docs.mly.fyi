In order to send emails using Amazon SES, you need to configure the AWS credentials in the `.env` file. Here are the steps to get the AWS credentials:

1. [Create an AWS account](https://go.mly.fyi/mly-signup-aws) if you don't have one.
2. [Create an IAM user](https://go.mly.fyi/mly-iam-user) with the following permissions:
   - `AmazonSESFullAccess` - To be able to send emails using Amazon SES.
   - `AmazonSNSFullAccess` - To be able to send bounce and complaint notifications to an SNS topic.
   - `AmazonS3FullAccess` - To store the database backups in an S3 bucket. We will be using [Litestream](https://litestream.io/install/) for backups, and restoring the database from the backups _(mainly for production)_.
3. After creating the IAM user, open the user and go to the `Security credentials` tab. Now `Create access key` and download the `Access key ID` and `Secret access key`.
4. Update the `.env` file with the following environment variables:

```bash
# Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) Configuration
AWS_SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_SES_REGION=
AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL=
```

> The `AWS_SES_REGION` is the region where you created the IAM user. You can find the region in the `Security credentials` tab of the IAM user. The `AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL` is the email address from which the transactional emails for the app will be sent.

5. **[ONLY PRODUCTION]** - Now go to the `S3` service and create a new bucket. Update the `.env` file with the following environment variables:

```bash
# Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Configuration
REPLICA_ACCESS_KEY_ID= # SAME AS AWS_SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID (Step 4)
REPLICA_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= # SAME AS AWS_SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (Step 4)
REPLICA_REGION= # SAME AS AWS_SES_REGION (Step 4)
REPLICA_BUCKET_NAME=
```

> The `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME` is the name of the bucket you created in the S3 service. This is where all of the database backups will be stored.

Now you are good to go! You can start the local development server by following the steps from the [Contributing](/docs/contributing) guide. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to me on [X](https://x.com/imarikchakma).
