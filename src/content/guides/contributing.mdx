You can start the local development server by following the steps below, but before that, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download) - You can also use the Redis Docker image.

> Remember to finish the [AWS Configurations](/docs/aws-configurations) before starting the process.

## Local Development

Now we can start the local server by following the steps below:

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/arikchakma/mly.fyi.git` and `cd mly.fyi`.
2. Copy the environment variables `cp .env.example .env`.
3. Replace the values of the environment variables in the `.env` file with your own values.
4. Install the dependencies `pnpm install`.
5. Run the Database Migration, and start the server `pnpm run db:migrate && pnpm run dev`.

The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Start exploring the app!

## Improve Documentation

You can also help us improve the documentation. The documentation is written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and you can find the files in the `src/content/guides` directory in [this repository](https://git.new/mly-docs).

If you want to add a new guide, you can create a new file in the `src/content/guides` directory and follow the structure of the existing files. You can also update the existing files to improve the content.
