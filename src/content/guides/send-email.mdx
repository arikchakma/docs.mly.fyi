Before you start sending emails, you need to finish [Local Development](/guides/local-development) or [Production Deployment](/guides/deployment) first, a verified identity, and a API key created from the **_local/production_** environment.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/email/send \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Mly-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "from": "John Doe <john@example.com>",
    "to": "hello@example.com",
    "subject": "Hello",
    "text": "Hello, World!",
    "html": "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"
  }'
```

> There is a catch, for now you can include only `http` URLs in the `html` field. If you include `https` URLs and turn on the `click tracking` feature, you might get a warning from the [browser](https://github.com/arikchakma/mly.fyi/issues/26). I know it's not ideal (and the solution too), but I will add a feature to support `https` URLs soon.

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY`, and `http://localhost:3000` with the API key, and the URL of the app you created from the **_local/production_** environment. You can use any language to send an HTTP request to the API endpoint.

Here is an example using `Node.js`:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/email/send', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-Mly-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    from: 'John Doe <john@example.com>',
    to: 'hello@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello',
    text: 'Hello, World!',
    html: '<h1>Hello, World!</h1>',
  }),
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```
