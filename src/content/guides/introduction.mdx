### Tech Stack

Mly.fyi is built with the simplest stack and is easily extendable. Here are the technologies used:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - The main framework for building the full-stack app. It's so fun to work with Astro. You can just use any library you want without any restrictions.
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - A simple, fast, and lightweight ORM.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - A simple, lightweight and fit-for-purpose database for storing the data. _(Feel free to add support for databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)_.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - For caching and rate limiting.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Used for styling the app.
- [Litestream](https://litestream.io/) - For backing up the SQLite database to an S3 bucket.
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) - A fast, disk space-efficient package manager.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - For containerizing the app.
- [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) - For sending transactional emails like password reset, email verification, etc.
