**Mly.fyi** helps you track your email deliveries, opens, clicks, and bounces. It's a self-hosted alternative to services like Mailgun, Sendgrid, and Postmark using the Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) for sending emails. Here is a working demo of the app: [demo.mly.fyi](https://go.mly.fyi/mly-demo).

### Features

Here are some of the features:

- Track email deliveries, opens, clicks, and bounces.
- Send emails cheaply using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).
- Use your own domain for sending emails, and add as many domains as you want.
- Invite team members to collaborate on your project.
- Self-hosted and open-source.
- More features coming soon!

To get started, you can follow the [deployment guide](/docs/deployment) to deploy on your server.

### Tech Stack

Initially, I started exploring the [Tiny Stack](https://go.mly.fyi/tiny-stack) then I really liked the idea of using the smallest possible stack to build a web application. So, I decided to use the following technologies:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - The main framework for building the full-stack app. It's so fun to work with Astro. You can just use any library you want without any restrictions.
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - A simple, fast, and lightweight ORM. I never used it before, then I thought why not give it a try. I really like it.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - A simple and lightweight database for storing the data, and the best part is that I don't have to worry about setting up a database server _(Maybe you can think about adding other databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)_. I'm using SQLite for now.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - Mainly for caching the data.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - I didn't consider using any other CSS framework(for now) because I really like Tailwind CSS.
- [Litestream](https://litestream.io/) - For backing up the SQLite database to an S3 bucket.
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) - A fast, disk space-efficient package manager.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - For containerizing the app.
- [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) - For sending transactional emails like password reset, email verification, etc.
